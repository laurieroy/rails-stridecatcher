# Stridecatcher

This is a Strava clone, built following Steve Polito's [tutorial](https://www.railscodealong.com). He uses BS4, Travis-CI for the builds, and mini test. 

Ruby(2.6.3) on Rails (6.1.3.2) using PG (13) for the db. UI is Bootstrap 5.0, for now. I'm using RSpec / FactoryBot for testing.
